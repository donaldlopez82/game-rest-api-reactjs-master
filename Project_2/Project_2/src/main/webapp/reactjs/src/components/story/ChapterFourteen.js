            Against your best judgement, you decide to open the door for the
            lady. At first, she seems nice, and begins telling you about how a
            zombie apocalypse started in space. Apparently, according to the
            people in the Bio department, someone had taken a chicken-like alien
            animal on another excursion and decided to try breeding it with the
            other chickens on board for food. However, after a few weeks,
            apparently the alien began to bite other chickens and spread a
            rabies-like virus between the animals. They quarantined the animals,
            but the virus spread to all the chickens and eventually mutated and
            jumped to humans. In this last mutation, the virus is unmistakeably
            as a zombification, highly contagious virus that turns people into
            ravenous, undead beings. You shiver as she recants the story. But
            then, just five minutes after she tells you this, she begins to
            snarl and groan oddly, and before you know it, she has a craving for
            human flesh. She bites you, and you live out the rest of your days
            as a space zombie. <br></br>Ending 5/10

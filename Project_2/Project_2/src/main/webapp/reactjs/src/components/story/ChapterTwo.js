            Getting out of your bed, you decide to answer your pager out of pure
            curiosity. You hit the button to connect and hear the pre-recorded
            distress signal. "THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY. A
            SECURITY CONTAINMENT BREACH HAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE MORGUE. AN
            INTER-GALACTIC BIOLOGICAL EVENT IS IMMINENT. PLEASE REPORT TO YOUR
            TEAM LEADER IMMEDIATELY."<br></br>
            You're incredibly happy that you decided to get out of bed when you
            did. An inter-galactic biological event? That doesn't sound very
            pleasant. You put on your shoes, take your crew ID with you, and
            grab your bag with all your valuables. You head out the door to
            meet at the emergency rendezvous point.<br></br>
            Once you arrive, you don't see the rest of your team there waiting
            like you usually do during safety drills. You decide to wait a few
            more minutes, but no one arrives. Then, you hear another
            announcement being played over the ship's intercom. "ATTENTION CREW
            MEMBERS: AN EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED. A SECURITY CONTAINMENT
            BREACH HAS OCCURRED WITHIN THE MORGUE. DO NOT REPORT TO YOUR
            EMERGENCY STATIONS. PLEASE STAY QUARANTINED IN YOUR ROOMS AND WAIT
            FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. DO NOT OPEN YOUR DOORS FOR ANYONE BESIDES
            YOUR TEAM LEADERS. QUARANTINE ALONE AND NOT WITH OTHERS." The
            message repeated once more before stopping.<br></br>
            You start hearing people begin to peek out of their doors, confused
            and curious about the recent announcement. At your emergency
            station, there is a cabinet with a gun for defensive purposes.
            Whatever is happening, you realize it's pretty serious, and just
            quarantining in your room might not be enough. You could grab the
            gun and explore the area of the ship to see what's going on, or you
            could play it safe and go back to your room to quarantine. Do you...

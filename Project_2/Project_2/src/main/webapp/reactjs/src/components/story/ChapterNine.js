            There's no reason to waste energy by packing or moving around, so
            you decide to rest and wait for the next instructions. Nothing
            happens for a while, and you are about to fall back asleep when you
            suddenly receive a knock at the door. Looking through the peephole,
            you realize it is another crew member. She looks very disheveled,
            like she had just been through something strenuous. "Please come
            with me," she says, "there's a viral outbreak turning people into
            zombies... it's nothing like what we've seen before! You won't
            survive this alone in your room!" Do you...

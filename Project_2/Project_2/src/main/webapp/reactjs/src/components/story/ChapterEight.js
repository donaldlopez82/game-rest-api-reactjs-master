            It's better to prep and be ready for something rather than be caught
            by surprise, right? You gather up all your emergency supplies and
            extra snacks and wait for someone to give you further instructions.
            Since you were woken up in the middle of the night, you get hungry
            and decide to eat one of the snacks. You continue waiting for
            someone to come, but they never do. You stay up all night waiting
            for news in the morning, but it never comes. You decide to eat
            another snack bar for breakfast.<br></br>
            The hours turn into days of waiting. You wish you hadn't eaten all
            your rations so soon, but you were hungry, and there was no way of
            knowing if help was coming sooner rather than later. The power to
            your room eventually shuts off, telling you that the workers who are
            responsible for keeping the power are probably dead. You know your
            time is coming soon. One day, someone that looks like a crewmate
            comes and pries open your door.<br></br>
            You're too weak to fight, and your death comes slowly and painfully.

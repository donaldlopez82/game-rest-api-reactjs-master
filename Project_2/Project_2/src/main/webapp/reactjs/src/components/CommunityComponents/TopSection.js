            Welcome to the General Discussion forum! This forum is here to

            Community forums work best when participants treat their fellow
            posters with respect and courtesy, so we ask that you take the time
            to read through the forum Code of Conduct and guidelines before
            posting.{' '}

              In addition to the forum Code of Conduct 587, here are some common
              courtesy guidelines to follow. While these do technically fall
              within the bounds of the Code of Conduct, they cover more specific
              examples of common errors that will lead to thread deletions or
              posting privileges being revoked. The Zombie Apocalypse forums are
              for discussion of topics directly related to Zombie Apocalypse.
              The forums here are specifically to discuss the game and related
              topics. Any topics not related to Zombie Apocalypse, CYOA.net, or
              CYOA Entertainment are subject to deletion. Don’t post in all
              capital letters, use a misleading title, excessive punctuation,
              and/or non-standard symbols, etc.

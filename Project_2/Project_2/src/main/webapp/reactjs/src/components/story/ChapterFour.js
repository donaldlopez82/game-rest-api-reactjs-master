            Whatever is happening must be pretty serious, so you decide to play
            it safe and go back to your room to quarantine. Whatever is going
            around must be contagious if they want all crew members to be
            separated from each other. Your mind begins to wonder, and you
            remember your training you had to do before leaving Earth for the
            first time. In emergencies, the people to survive the longest were
            the ones that were prepared beforehand for their own survival. Each
            crew member had a cabinet of emergency items set aside for something
            just like this, and depending on each situation, crew members were
            supposed to prepare differently with these items. If the emergency
            required an evacuation, crew members were instructed to pack
            necessary items like food and survival gear, maybe even eat a snack
            for energy. If the emergency required a true quarantine, crew
            members were instructed to rest and conserve energy/supplies.
            Overall, it looks like your two choices are between prepping for an
            escape pod by eating and gathering supplies or going back to bed to
            conserve energy. Do you...

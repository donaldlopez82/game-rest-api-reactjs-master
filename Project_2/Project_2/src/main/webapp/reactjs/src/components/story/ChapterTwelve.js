            It might have been selfish, but you decide that your best course of
            action is to save yourself before the zombie can make it to your
            pod. However, you didn't know that not only did your crewmate have
            coordinates to another ship that could have saved you, he also had
            emergency rations in case something happened and you were left to
            drift in space. Your selfishness ends up betraying you, and you are
            left to drift for all eternity. <br></br>Ending 4/10
